steps to do a DMA FIFO 1/2 interrupt (Timer 0/1 drive the DMA FIFO)

Set ARM7 Timer0/1, when they interrupt, read DMA 1/2 properties ONLY
if bit 3 special is set

write DMACNT_LH with bit 3 (sound FIFO)

call CPUCheckDMA(3, dmamask[DMA0==1,DMA1==2,DMA2==4,DMA3==8]) /
read from IO ports what offset , source address, and what FIFO dest.
From ARM7

When transfer is ready, DMA 1/2 should raise an interrupt


then ARM7 should clear the IF from DMA Sources, once played 
the FIFO + index buffer.
